# 🚦 Accident Prediction System

A machine learning web application that predicts the likelihood of road accidents based on various input factors.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a B.Tech CSE graduate with a strong interest in Data Science and Development.  
I have completed a Data Science course and actively work on real-world projects to sharpen my skills.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model that can estimate the probability of a road accident occurring based on parameters like weather, time, road conditions, and location.

## 🔍 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Trained ML models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Web interface for real-time prediction input
- Deployment using Streamlit / Flask

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
